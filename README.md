Problem Statement
The notebooks explores the basic use of Pandas and will cover the basic commands of Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) which includes cleaning, munging, combining, reshaping, slicing, dicing, and transforming data for analysis purpose.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Understand the data by EDA and derive simple models with Pandas as baseline. EDA ia a critical and first step in analyzing the data and we do this for below reasons :

Finding patterns in Data
Determining relationships in Data
Checking of assumptions
Preliminary selection of appropriate models
Detection of mistakes
Data Loading and Description
The dataset consists information collected from car sale advertisements for study/practice purpose where most of them're used cars.
The dataset comprises of 9576 observations of 10 columns. Below is a table showing names of all the columns and their description.


Column Name	Description
car	Manufacturer brand
price	Seller’s price in advertisement (in USD)
body	Car body type
mileage	as mentioned in advertisement (‘000 Km)
engV	rounded engine volume (‘000 cubic cm)
engType	type of fuel (“Other” in this case should be treated as NA)
registration	whether car registered in Ukraine or not
year	year of production
model	specific model name
drive	drive type
Some Background Information
This data was collected from private car sale advertisements in Ukraine and provided by INSAID team to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
This dataset has real raw data which has all inconvenient moments (as NA’s for example).
This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation.
